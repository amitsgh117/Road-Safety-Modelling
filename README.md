# Road-Safety-Modelling

* Developed a regression model in R for pedestrian volumes and obtained the best fit model with R^2 = 0.71
* Built another log-linear model for non negative predictions and arrived at a conclusion that linear model had a better fitness
* Removed variables having lower correlation with dependent variable and combined variable that were highly correlated with each
other to obtain the best fit model
* Wrote a term paper titled ‘Use of Mobile Phone and Road Safety’ containing a review, comparison and a-priori hypothesis
test of two Structural Equation Models (SEM) of Road Safety Risk perception due to Mobile Phone Use
